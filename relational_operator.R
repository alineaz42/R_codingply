# basically there are six types of relational operator 
# <,> , <= , >= , == , !=


a <- 10
b <- 20
# if a>b:
#   print("a is greater than b")
# else:
#   print("a is less than b.")

a>b
a<b
a==b
a != b
a<=b
a>=b


# the logic is same in float number or double 
x <- 32.43
y <- 43.53
x>y
x<=y

c <- "Hello"
d <- "Neo"
c>d
c<=d

# multiple relational operator can't be used in sequency
